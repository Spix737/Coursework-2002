#This project is split into two parts.

#Part 1 is to train several different regressors (Random Forest, MLP and SVG) to predict energy efficiency values for a given dataset and compare each regression algorithm.

#Part 2 is an optimisation problem for a timetable, in which given 2 types of constraints I built a fitness calculator and a hillclimber to obtain the best possible timetable.
